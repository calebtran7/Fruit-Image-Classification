# Fruit-Image-Classification

This project focuses on building a robust image classification model to accurately identify and classify various types of fruits in images. I did this project in Python and utilized deep learning libraries such as Tensorflow and Keras. 

# Dataset
Here is where I sourced the data from: 

The dataset consisted of 33 classes of different fruits, with each class containing images of the fruit in varying orientations against a white background.
